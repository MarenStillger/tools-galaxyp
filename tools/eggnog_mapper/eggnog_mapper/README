This folder contains three tools: 

1. eggnogg_mapper: which runs the search and annotation phase in a single tool
2. eggnogg_mapper_search: which implements the search phase
3. eggnogg_mapper_annotate: which implements the annotation phase

While the search phase of eggnog_mapper is very CPU intense and is efficient
also for larger number of threads, the anotation phase is very IO intensive
and can be very inefficient (depending on the configuration, e.g. if the
reference data is located on a slow partition).

While for most applications eggnogg_mapper will be sufficient separating the
two phases can be more efficient: 

- sending eggnogg_mapper_search to a destination using many threads
- and eggnogg_mapper_annotate to a destination using a small numbe of threads

If eggnogg_mapper_annotate is send to a single core destination
the option `--dbmem` is activated which will copy the complete
EggNOG annotation DB into memory which is usually much faster
than using multiple cores (but needs approx. 37GB of RAM).
